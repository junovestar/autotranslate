Hey guys, just wanted to show you real

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:09,360
quick that we have been working on the Automation Squad

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:14,960
school community. So if you want free instant

4
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:18,800
value, we've been putting a lot of stuff together.

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,480
So we've got our daily newsletter. It's going to talk about

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,080
prompts, actionable tips,

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,910
and also like kind of the latest of what's going

8
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,900
going on. But we break it down with like, why you should care

9
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,020
and like,

10
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,060
who should care. What problem does this solve?

11
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,820
Like if it's a tool. And then our prompts are like super complex,

12
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:51,500
so they're not like really basic stuff that you can find

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,100
everywhere. So check that out. And then

14
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,500
also if you go over to the classroom section, we've got

15
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:05,130
N8N automation templates, prompts and tools.

16
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:09,850
So if you go in here, these are tons

17
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:14,210
of N8N automation templates that

18
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:19,050
we have found across the Internet and

19
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:24,050
put all into one spot here. So there's literally thousands

20
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:28,010
of them, all for free. These are ones that are available

21
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:31,540
for free out there, but they're just

22
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,700
like scattered. And so we put them all in one place for

23
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,180
you. And then if you go back here, you've got prompts and

24
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,420
tools and these are all just like those complex

25
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,780
prompts that we like to build and ones that we found

26
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:51,620
and bought as well that we're allowed to offer

27
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,980
for free. And then Tools is like a really great tools

28
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,660
directory. So anyways, check it out. I hope you

29
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,680
