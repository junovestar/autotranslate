00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:05,120
Hey guys, just wanted to show you real

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:09,920
quick that we have been working on the Automation Squad school

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,960
community. So if you want free instant

4
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,470
value, we've been putting a lot of stuff together.

5
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,480
So we've got

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:25,120
our daily newsletter. It's going to talk about prompts,

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,800
actionable tips, and also like

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,340
kind of the latest of what's going going on. But we

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,260
break it down with like, why you should care and

10
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,300
like, who should care. What problem does

11
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,300
this solve? Like if it's a tool. And then our prompts are

12
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,620
like super complex, so they're not like really basic stuff

13
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,100
that you can find everywhere. So check that out. And then

14
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,820
also if you go over to the classroom section,

15
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,970
we've got N8N automation templates,

16
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:06,930
prompts and tools. So if

17
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:12,170
you go in here, these are tons of N8N

18
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,090
automation templates that we have found

19
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,410
across the Internet and put

20
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:24,050
all into one spot here. So there's literally thousands

21
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:28,610
of them, all for free. These are ones that are available for

22
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:32,700
free out there, but they're just like scattered.

23
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,020
And so we put them all in one place for you.

24
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:40,820
And then if you go back here, you've got prompts and tools

25
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:45,100
and these are all just like those complex prompts

26
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,980
that we like to build and ones that we found and bought as

27
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:53,460
well that we're allowed to offer for free. And then

28
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,940
Tools is like a really great tools directory. So anyways,

29
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,680
check it out. I hope you guys enjoy it. Let us know what thing.
