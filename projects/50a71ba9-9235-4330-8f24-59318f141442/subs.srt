00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:05,120
Hey guys, just wanted to show you real

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:09,360
quick that we have been working on the Automation Squad

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,040
school community. So if you want free

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,000
instant value, we've been putting a lot

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,150
of stuff together. So we've got our daily newsletter.

6
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:21,800
It's going

7
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,120
to talk about prompts,

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,200
actionable tips, and also

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,460
like kind of the latest of what's going going on.

10
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:37,260
But we break it down with like, why you should care and

11
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,900
like, who should care. What problem

12
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:45,540
does this solve? Like if it's a tool. And then our

13
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,340
prompts are like super complex, so they're not like really

14
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,140
basic stuff that you can find everywhere.

15
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:56,660
So check that out. And then also if

16
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,290
you go over to the classroom section, we've got N8N

17
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,130
automation templates, prompts and tools.

18
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:09,850
So if you go in here, these are tons

19
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:13,850
of N8N automation templates

20
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:19,050
that we have found across the Internet and

21
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:24,050
put all into one spot here. So there's literally thousands

22
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:28,010
of them, all for free. These are ones that are available

23
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:32,700
for free out there, but they're just like scattered.

24
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,020
And so we put them all in one place for you.

25
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:40,820
And then if you go back here, you've got prompts and tools

26
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:44,420
and these are all just like those complex

27
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:48,180
prompts that we like to build and ones that we found and

28
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,340
bought as well that we're allowed to offer for free.

29
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,740
And then Tools is like a really great tools directory.

30
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,110
So anyways, check it out. I hope you guys enjoy it.

31
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,980

32
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:01,680
