Hey guys, just wanted to show you

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:09,360
real quick that we have been working on the Automation Squad

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,040
school community. So if you want free

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,800
instant value, we've been putting a

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,050
lot of stuff together. So we've got our daily newsletter.

6
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,800
It's going

7
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,120
to talk about prompts,

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,800
actionable tips, and also like

9
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,060
kind of the latest of what's going going on. But we break it down

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,020
with like, why you should care and like,

11
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,060
who should care. What problem does this solve?

12
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,020
Like if it's a tool. And then our prompts are like super

13
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,980
complex, so they're not like really basic stuff that you

14
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,100
can find everywhere. So check that out. And then

15
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,500
also if you go over to the classroom section, we've got

16
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:04,330
N8N automation templates, prompts and

17
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,810
tools. So if you go in

18
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,170
here, these are tons of N8N

19
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,090
automation templates that we have found

20
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,770
across the Internet and put all

21
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:24,250
into one spot here. So there's literally thousands of

22
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,970
them, all for free. These are ones that are available for free

23
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:33,940
out there, but they're just like scattered. And so we

24
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:38,020
put them all in one place for you. And then if you go

25
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,100
back here, you've got prompts and tools and these are all just

26
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,780
like those complex prompts that we like to build and ones that we found

27
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:51,620
and bought as well that we're allowed to offer

28
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,980
