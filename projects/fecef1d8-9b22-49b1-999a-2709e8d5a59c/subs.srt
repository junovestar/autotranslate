00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:05,520
Hey guys, just wanted to show you real quick

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,360
that we have been working on the Automation Squad

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,040
school community. So if you want free

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,800
instant value, we've been putting a

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,050
lot of stuff together. So we've got our daily newsletter.

6
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,800
It's going

7
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,120
to talk about prompts,

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,800
actionable tips, and also like

9
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,060
kind of the latest of what's going going on. But we break it down

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,020
with like, why you should care and like,

11
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,060
who should care. What problem does this solve?

12
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,020
Like if it's a tool. And then our prompts are like super

13
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,220
complex, so they're not like really basic

14
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,820
stuff that you can find everywhere. So check

15
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,820
that out. And then also if you go over to the classroom section,

16
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,970
we've got N8N automation templates,

17
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:07,250
prompts and tools. So if you

18
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:12,170
go in here, these are tons of N8N

19
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,090
automation templates that we have found

20
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,770
across the Internet and put all

21
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:24,050
into one spot here. So there's literally thousands

22
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:27,730
of them, all for free. These are ones that are

23
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:32,700
available for free out there, but they're just like scattered.

24
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,020
And so we put them all in one place for you.

25
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:40,820
And then if you go back here, you've got prompts and tools

26
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:45,100
and these are all just like those complex prompts

27
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,980
that we like to build and ones that we found and bought as well that

28
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,300
we're allowed to offer for free. And then Tools is

29
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,940
like a really great tools directory. So anyways,

30
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,680
check it out. I hope you guys enjoy it. Let us know what thing.
