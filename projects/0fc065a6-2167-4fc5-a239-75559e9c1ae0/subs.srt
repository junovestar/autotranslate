00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:05,120
Hey guys, just wanted to show you real

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:08,720
quick that we have been working on the Automation

3
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:14,960
Squad school community. So if you want free instant

4
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,470
value, we've been putting a lot of stuff together.

5
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,480
So we've got

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:25,120
our daily newsletter. It's going to talk about prompts,

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,200
actionable tips, and also

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,460
like kind of the latest of what's going going on.

9
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:37,260
But we break it down with like, why you should care and

10
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,300
like, who should care. What problem does

11
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,300
this solve? Like if it's a tool. And then our prompts are

12
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,220
like super complex, so they're not like really basic

13
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,460
stuff that you can find everywhere. So check that out.

14
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:58,140
And then also if you go over to the classroom

15
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:02,250
section, we've got N8N automation

16
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:05,130
templates, prompts and tools.

17
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:09,850
So if you go in here, these are tons

18
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:13,850
of N8N automation templates

19
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:19,050
that we have found across the Internet and

20
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:24,050
put all into one spot here. So there's literally thousands

21
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:28,610
of them, all for free. These are ones that are available for

22
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:32,700
free out there, but they're just like scattered.

23
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,020
And so we put them all in one place for you.

24
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:40,820
And then if you go back here, you've got prompts and tools

25
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:44,420
and these are all just like those complex

26
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:48,700
prompts that we like to build and ones that we found and bought

27
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,340
as well that we're allowed to offer for free.

28
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,740
And then Tools is like a really great tools directory.

29
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,500
So anyways, check it out. I hope you guys enjoy it.

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,680
